/**
 * 1. You are given a number 'n', representing the size of array 'a'.
 * 2. You are given 'n' numbers, representing elements of array 'a'.
 * 3. Elements of array are sorted
 * 4. You are required to search an element/data/value in the arrays if it is
 * present or not.
 * 
 * Hint: We are using "Binary Search Algorithm" here
 * 
 * Note:- we can also do this with Linear Search but it takes more time because
 * we will have iterate over every single element and compare and find the data.
 * So, since the array provided is sorted we can easliy use Binary Search
